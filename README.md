# Scalex Global LLP - Static Website

Modern, responsive multi-page static website for Scalex Global LLP (water treatment & scaling solutions).

## Structure
- index.html
- about.html
- services.html
- projects.html
- contact.html
- .github/workflows/deploy.yml

## Tech
- HTML + Tailwind CSS (CDN) â€” mobile-first responsive design.
- Mailto-based contact form (lightweight). Can be upgraded to Formspree / EmailJS.

## Deploy
This repo includes a GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`) to automatically deploy the site to `gh-pages` branch using `peaceiris/actions-gh-pages`. To enable automatic publish:
1. Add this project files and commit to `main`.
2. The workflow uses the built-in `GITHUB_TOKEN` to push to `gh-pages` branch.

Note: If your repository has branch protections preventing the workflow's token from pushing, create a deploy key or use a personal access token in secrets.

## Notes
- Replace placeholder phone/email with real contact info.
- Replace images with owned assets when available.
- For improved performance consider a Tailwind build pipeline and image optimization.
